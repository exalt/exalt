## What Does This Toolchain Do?

This toolchain enables the following features for @exalt/cli:
- JavaScript & Typescript bundling, transpilation, and minification.
- Import aliasing.
- Live reloading development server.
- Generation of HTML based on output files.
- Support for importing css files.
- Support for importing json files.
- Support for folder components.
- Support for decorators.
- Code Splitting.


This toolchain offers some options to configure this functionality.

#### Options:
- library (default: false) - sets the project to be compiled as a library.
- target (default: "es2015") - sets the JavaScript version to be transpiled to.
- codesplitting (default: false) - specifies whether or not to use a code splitting build.
- minify (default: false) - determines whether or not the build should be minified.
- sourcemap (default: false) - determines whether or not sourcemaps should be generated.
- paths (default: {}) - object that maps aliases to file paths.
- publicPath (default: "/") - the asset path to append to the beginning of all asset paths.
- open (default: true) - tells the cli whether or not to launch your app or not.
- port (default: 3000) - sets the web server port.
- headers (default: {}) - sets headers to be sent with each request/response.

## TypeScript Support

Typescript support is ready out of the box. All you need to do is change your files to have a `.ts` file extension and make sure your `input` field is updated in exalt.json. The toolchain will then automatically compile your code down to JavaScript.
